	abstract = {Recent increases in market concentration among health plans, hospitals, and medical groups raise questions about what impact such mergers are having on costs to consumers. We examined the impact of market concentration on the growth of health insurance premiums between 2014 and 2015 in two Affordable Care Act state-based Marketplaces: Covered California and NY State of Health. We measured health plan, hospital, and medical group market concentration using the well-known Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) and used a multivariate regression model to relate these measures to premium growth. Both states exhibited a positive association between hospital concentration and premium growth and a positive (but not statistically significant) association between medical group concentration and premium growth. Our results for health plan concentration differed between the two states: It was positively associated with premium growth in New York but negatively associated with premium growth in California. The health plan concentration finding in Covered California may be the result of its selectively contracting with health plans.},

	abstract = {The long-term trend of consolidation among US health plans has raised providers’ concerns that the concentration of health plan markets can depress their prices. Although our study confirmed that, it also revealed a more complex picture. First, we found that 64 percent of hospitals operate in markets where health plans are not very concentrated, and only 7 percent are in markets that are dominated by a few health plans. Second, we found that in most markets, hospital market concentration exceeds health plan concentration. Third, our study confirmed earlier studies showing that greater hospital market concentration leads to higher hospital prices. Fourth, we found that hospital prices in the most concentrated health plan markets are approximately 12 percent lower than in more competitive health plan markets. Overall, our results show that more concentrated health plan markets can counteract the price-increasing effects of concentrated hospital markets, and that—contrary to conventional wisdom—increased health plan concentration benefits consumers through lower hospital prices as long as health plan markets remain competitive. Our findings also suggest that consumers would benefit from policies that maintained competition in hospital markets or that would restore competition to hospital markets that are uncompetitive.},

	abstract = {Prices are the major driver of why the United States spends so much more on health care than other countries do. The pricing power that hospitals have garnered recently has resulted from consolidated delivery systems and concentrated markets, leading to enhanced negotiating leverage. But consolidation may be the wrong frame for viewing the problem of high and highly variable prices; many “must-have” hospitals achieve their pricing power from sources other than consolidation, for example, reputation. Further, the frame of consolidation leads to unrealistic expectations for what antitrust’s role in addressing pricing power should be, especially because in the wake of two periods of merger “manias” and “frenzies” many markets already lack effective competition. It is particularly challenging for antitrust to address extant monopolies lawfully attained. New payment and delivery models being pioneered in Medicare, especially those built around accountable care organizations (ACOs), offer an opportunity to reduce pricing power, but only if they are implemented with a clear eye on the impact on prices in commercial insurance markets. This article proposes approaches that public and private payers should consider to complement the role of antitrust to assure that ACOs will actually help control costs in commercial markets as well as in Medicare and Medicaid.},

While the relationship between the number of insurers and Marketplace premiums has received widespread attention, the role of hospital market concentration on premiums has been understudied. We examined the relationship between hospital market concentration and Marketplace insurance premiums in the period 2014–17, the extent to which the number of insurers modified this relationship, and whether community-level characteristics were associated with varying levels of concentration. We found that areas with the highest levels of hospital market concentration had annual premiums that were, on average, 5 percent higher than those in the least concentrated areas. Additionally, while an increased number of insurers was independently associated with lower premiums, that was not sufficient to offset the effects of increased hospital concentration on premium costs. Communities with lower socioeconomic status (as measured by median income) were more likely to have higher hospital market concentration. However, this was not consistent across all measures of socioeconomic status, such as measures of unemployment, use of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and education. These findings help underscore the importance of exploring antitrust policy and other efforts that may reduce hospital concentration and help keep Marketplace premiums affordable.},

The Council of Economic Advisers recently expressed its concern about the lack of estimates of market concentration in many sectors of the US economy. To address this gap in health care, this study analyzed market concentration trends in the United States from 2010 to 2016 for hospitals, physician organizations, and health insurers. Hospital and physician organization markets became increasingly concentrated over this time period. Concentration among primary care physicians increased the most, partially because hospitals and health care systems acquired primary care physician organizations. In 2016, 90 percent of Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) were highly concentrated for hospitals, 65 percent for specialist physicians, 39 percent for primary care physicians, and 57 percent for insurers. Ninety-one percent of the 346 MSAs analyzed may have warranted concern and scrutiny because of their concentration levels in 2016 and changes in their concentrations since 2010. Public policies that enhance competition are needed, such as stricter enforcement of antitrust laws, reducing barriers to entry, and restricting anticompetitive behaviors.},

	abstract = {While the Affordable Care Act has expanded health insurance to millions of Americans through the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid and the health insurance Marketplaces, concerns about Marketplace stability persist—given increasing premiums and multiple insurers exiting selected markets. Yet there has been little investigation of what factors underlie this pattern. We assessed the county-level prevalence of limited insurer participation (defined as having two or fewer distinct participating insurers) in Marketplaces in the period 2014–18. Overall, in 2015 and 2016 rates of insurer participation were largely stable, and approximately 80 percent of counties (containing 93 percent of US residents) had at least three Marketplace insurers. However, these proportions declined sharply starting in 2017, falling to 36 percent of counties and 60 percent of the population in 2018. We also examined county-level factors associated with limited insurer competition and found that it occurred disproportionately in rural counties, those with higher mortality rates, and those where insurers had lower medical loss ratios (that is, potentially higher profit margins), as well as in states where Republicans controlled the executive and legislative branches of government. Decreased competition was less common in states with higher proportions of residents who were Hispanic or ages 45–64 and states that chose to expand Medicaid.},

We hypothesized that Medicaid expansion of eligibility for childless adults prevents hospital closures because increased Medicaid coverage for previously uninsured people reduces uncompensated care expenditures and strengthens hospitals’ financial position. We tested this hypothesis using data for the period 2008–16 on hospital closures and financial performance. We found that the ACA’s Medicaid expansion was associated with improved hospital financial performance and substantially lower likelihoods of closure, especially in rural markets and counties with large numbers of uninsured adults before Medicaid expansion. Future congressional efforts to reform Medicaid policy should consider the strong relationship between Medicaid coverage levels and the financial viability of hospitals. Our results imply that reverting to pre-ACA eligibility levels would lead to particularly large increases in rural hospital closures. Such closures could lead to reduced access to care and a loss of highly skilled jobs, which could have detrimental impacts on local economies.},

The analysis also explored how the ACA Medicaid expansion affects different types of hospitals by size, ownership, rurality, and safety-net status. We found that the early positive financial impact of Medicaid expansion was sustained in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as hospitals in expansion states continued to experience decreased uncompensated care costs and increased Medicaid revenue and financial margins. The magnitude of these impacts varied by hospital type. As COVID-19 has brought hospitals to a time of great need, findings from this study provide important information on what hospitals in states that have yet to expand Medicaid could gain through expansion and what is at risk should any reversal of Medicaid expansions occur.},

	abstract = {Maryland, with its all-payer rate-setting system for hospital services, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are launching a new model that will transform the state's delivery system and may guide other federal–state partnerships in improving health care. On January 10, 2014, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the State of Maryland jointly announced the launch of a statewide model that will transform Maryland's health care delivery system. Although some aspects of the new approach may be unique to Maryland and not applicable elsewhere, both the principles of this model and the process that led to its development may serve as a guide for future federal–state partnership efforts aiming to improve health care and to lower costs through an all-payer approach. Since the late 1970s, Maryland has operated what is now the country's only all-payer . . .},

	abstract = {California has heavily concentrated hospital, physician, and health insurance markets, but their current structure and functioning is not well understood. We assessed consolidation trends and performed an analysis of “hot spots”—markets that potentially warrant concern and scrutiny by regulators in terms of both horizontal concentration (such as hospital-hospital mergers) and vertical integration (hospitals’ acquisition of physician practices). In 2016, seven counties were high on all six measures used in our hot-spot analysis (four horizontal concentration and two vertical integration measures), and five counties were high on five. The percentage of physicians in practices owned by a hospital increased from about 25 percent in 2010 to more than 40 percent in 2016. The estimated impact of the increase in vertical integration from 2013 to 2016 in highly concentrated hospital markets was found to be associated with a 12 percent increase in Marketplace premiums. For physician outpatient services, the increase in vertical integration was also associated with a 9 percent increase in specialist prices and a 5 percent increase in primary care prices. Legislative proposals, actions by the state’s attorney general, and other regulatory changes are suggested.},

	abstract = {Much has been written about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the 5 years since its inception, both in scholarly journals and the popular press. Initial interest focused on states’ decisions about whether to implement their own insurance marketplaces and accept Medicaid expansion. There were countless accounts of dismal enrollment experiences marred by technical glitches during the initial enrollment period in late 2013 and early 2014. With implementation issues settled by the Supreme Court, and state and federal websites much improved, attention has recently turned to the operational aspects of the insurance markets. In particular, concerns have been increasing about the often limited hospital and physician networks offered by insurance plans sold in the marketplaces.},

There are 3.9 participants, on (population-weighted) average, in the 395 ratings areas spanning the 34 states with federally facilitated marketplaces (FFMs). Using data on the plans offered in the FFMs, together with predicted market shares for HIM participants (estimated using 2011 insurer-state market shares in the individual insurance market), we study the impact of competition on premiums. We exploit variation in ratings-area-level competition induced by UnitedHealthcare’s decision not to participate in any of the FFMs. We estimate that the second-lowest-price silver premium (which is directly linked to federal subsidies) would have decreased by 5.4 percent, on average, had UnitedHealthcare participated. If all insurers active in each state’s individual insurance market in 2011 had participated in all ratings areas in that state’s HIM, we estimate this key premium would be 11.1\% lower and 2014 federal subsidies would be reduced by \$1.7 billion.},

	abstract = {Anecdotal reports and systematic research highlight the prevalence of narrow-network plans on the Affordable Care Act’s health insurance Marketplaces. At the same time, Marketplace premiums in the period 2014–16 were much lower than projected by the Congressional Budget Office in 2009. Using detailed data on the breadth of both hospital and physician networks, we studied the prevalence of narrow networks and quantified the association between network breadth and premiums. Controlling for many potentially confounding factors, we found that a plan with narrow physician and hospital networks was 16 percent cheaper than a plan with broad networks for both, and that narrowing the breadth of just one type of network was associated with a 6–9 percent decrease in premiums. Narrow-network plans also have a sizable impact on federal outlays, as they depress the premium of the second-lowest-price silver plan, to which subsidy amounts are linked. Holding all else constant, we estimate that federal subsidies would have been 10.8 percent higher in 2014 had Marketplaces required all plans to offer broad provider networks. Narrow networks are a promising source of potential savings for other segments of the commercial insurance market.},
