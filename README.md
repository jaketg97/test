## Hi there!

My name's Jake, and I'm an aspiring applied microeconomist hoping to specialize in public or labor economics. Right now I'm working as a research analyst at Northwestern University in the Global Poverty Research Lab; I plan on applying to Econ PhD programs next fall (Autumn 2021). I use this site to share some of my personal research. **To be clear, all work shared here is preliminary and personal unless stated otherwise** (don't blame my employer for any of my shoddy work). Critiques are welcome at jaketg97@gmail.com. Before we get to the half-baked work though, here are some shameless plugs...

[Here's my CV](main_files/Gosselin, Jacob - CV.pdf) &nbsp; &nbsp; [And my twitter](https://twitter.com/jaketg97) &nbsp; &nbsp; [And my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgosselin/)
