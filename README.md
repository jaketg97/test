## Hi there!

My name's Jake, and I'm an aspiring applied microeconomist hoping to specialize in public or labor economics. Right now I'm working as a research analyst at Northwestern University in the Global Poverty Research Lab; I plan on applying to Econ PhD programs next fall (Autumn 2021). I use this site as a sounding board for my half baked ideas. **To be clear, all work shared here is preliminary and personal unless stated otherwise** (don't blame my employer for any of my shoddy work). Critiques are welcome at jaketg97@gmail.com. Before we get to the undeveloped ideas though, here are some shameless plugs...

[Here's my CV](main_files/Gosselin, Jacob - CV.pdf) &nbsp; &nbsp; [And my twitter](https://twitter.com/jaketg97) &nbsp; &nbsp; [And my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgosselin/) 

### And here are a few ideas that turned into things I'm proud of 
- **[Chicago’s harshest judge seeks retention](https://www.injusticewatch.org/news/2018/chicago-harshest-judge-seeks-retention/):** Piece I co-wrote (with help from a great team) on Judge Maura Slattery Boyle, as part of their coverage for the judicial retention races. [Injustice Watch](https://www.injusticewatch.org) continues to do some of the best reporting in Chicago; if you haven't yet, check out their [Judicial Election Guide](https://www.injusticewatch.org/interactives/judicial-election-guide/2020-general/en/)
- **[Fighting Royalty: The Daniel Biss Campaign for Governor](http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2018/7/4/fighting-royalty-daniel-biss-campaign-governor/):** probably the piece I'm proudest of from my day's at UChicago's undergraduate political review. Incredibly interesting campaign with a lot of great characters. Also includes a map I spent hours building in Tableau because I didn't know how to use R yet, so that's a nice memory.
- **[Insurer Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation](main_files/Insurer Competition in the Age of Provider Consolidation.pdf):** Wow that's a mouthful. Undergraduate thesis completed with the help of my wonderful advisor Professor Colleen Grogan. Using public data from CMS, and private data from the American Hospital Association (AHA), I tried to measure the impact of reduced healthcare provider competition on competition and prices in ACA exchanges. Imperfect work, but I think the general findings are correct.

## Now, for the good stuff (the good stuff being my probably bad ideas)
